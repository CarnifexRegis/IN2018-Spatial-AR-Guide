# AR Guided Tours

"AR Guided Tours" is a team project implemented as part of the courses Augmented Reality and 3D User Interfaces at Technical University of Munich. The project itself is a guidance application that uses markerless tracking to help users navigate through an unknown environment. The proposed solution allows people to visit the custom environment at their own pace without having to depend on another individual, offers users the possibility to diverge from a predetermined path and easily return to the last point of interest. The project contains two versions which can be put to use by the visitor: a simplistic environment-centered wayfinding approach and a further advanced, non-traditional assistant-based wayfinding approach. 

## Resources
In order to run the app, both an Azure Spatial Anchor and an Azure Speech resources need to be created. Verification info (e.g. id, key, service region) for Spatial Anchors needs to be inserted into Assets/AzureSpatialAnchors.SDK/Resources/SpatialAnchorConfig.asset and Speech Services info needs to be inserted into the corresponding field of *SpeechManager* in *AnchorWatcher* scene.
